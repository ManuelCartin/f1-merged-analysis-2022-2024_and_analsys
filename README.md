## Summary
This project merges and analyzes Formula 1 race data from 2022 to 2024, focusing on lap performance, pit strategy, and telemetry. It uses Python and Pandas to replicate some of the analysis performed by track engineers. This is evidenced by a video from the F1 fan community that claims AI is new and that F1 can only analyze data to evolve the sport so far. ## Technologies Used
- Python 3.10
- Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- FastF1
- CSV for data storage
## Dataset Structure
- Merged race data from 2022 to 2024
- Includes lap times, pit stops, tire compounds, weather, and driver positions
- Cleaned and saved as f1_final_archive_2022_2024.csv
## EDA and Strategic Modeling
- Lap-by-lap performance analysis
- Pit stop prediction and tire degradation modeling
- Visualization of race progression and strategic changes
