# F1 Insights: Creating a Data Product for Strategic Decision-Making
This project goes beyond data analysis; it's about creating a source of competitive intelligence for decision-making. My goal was to merge telemetry and strategy data from the 2022-2024 Formula 1 seasons to build a unique and valuable data product that would allow strategists and engineers to gain a competitive advantage.

The idea was born out of my curiosity about a video from the F1 community discussing the role of AI. I realized that a PM with strong data engineering skills could create the basic data product that AI would need to flourish. This project is a demonstration of that philosophy.

## Product Objective and Value Proposition
The main objective was to transform raw, disparate data into a centralized, ready-to-use dataset. This product allows users to:

Analyze lap-by-lap performance to identify strengths and weaknesses.

Model pit strategy and tire degradation to optimize race performance.

Visualize race progression to understand teams' strategic decisions.

The key value of this data product lies in simplifying the analysis process, freeing up the strategy and engineering teams' time so they can focus on innovation.

## Product and Technology Focus
My role was similar to that of a Product Manager (PM) in the data area. I led the following phases of the project:

Problem Identification: F1 data is scattered and unstructured, making rapid, strategic analysis difficult.

Data Product Design: I conceptualized the structure of the final dataset, defining which variables were critical for the analysis.

Development and Validation: I used Python with Pandas and FastF1 for data engineering. My focus was on cleaning and ritualizing the data to ensure its integrity, a critical step for any data product.

## Results and Future Opportunities
The final result is a consolidated dataset, f1_final_archive_2022_2024.csv, which serves as the basis for future analysis. This project is a minimum viable product (MVP) and opens the door to future iterations, such as:

Integration of predictive tire degradation models.

Analysis of the impact of weather on race strategy.

Development of an interactive dashboard for easier visualization.
